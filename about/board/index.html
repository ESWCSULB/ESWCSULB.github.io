    <p>Anesia is a Civil Engineering student with a focus on Environmental/Water Resources Engineering. She has strong interests in topics such as pollution prevention, water resources, waste water treatment, sustainability, biological remediation, and biomimicry. She is also interested in the relationship between the environment, politics, society, and economics along with how interdisciplinary collaboration (engineering, chemistry, biology, communications, art, political science, history, etc.) can be used to promote and create sustainability. Civil Engineering is actually Anesia's second bachelor's degree. Her first degree was in Japanese from UC Berkeley and she hopes to eventually be able to combine both her language and engineering skills in the future. Regarding languages, she has also learned some Spanish and Farsi. Having a broad range of knowledge, Anesia will often talk your socks off about above mentioned interests. Feel free to ask her (or stop her talking) about making non-toxic house cleaners, the development of traffic laws in the 1910's, growing orchids, how cheap tuition used to be in 2002, or whether your Japanese grammar is correct.</p>

    <p>Catherine began her undergraduate studies in Fall 2016 at CSULB where she majors in Electrical Engineering. From 2003 to 2012, she has volunteered with organizations like Saigon Foun­da­tion, Pro­ject Viet­nam, Hope Today, "Hai Ngoai Thi Ca", Young Generation Foundation, "Lac Hong" Performing Arts Group, and others to raise money for impoverished families so they can afford basic essentials and treat life-threatening illnesses. In 2012, she worked on a children’s show, which centered around Vietnamese and American culture, on channel 57.3. Catherine was also part of her high school’s Red Cross club for 4 years and served as Project Chair for her senior year. She helped install fire alarms and teach others about fire safety in the city of Santa Ana, help organize a blood drive, spread awareness of measles, and learn about CPR. She now hopes to be able to combine her interests of helping others and applying technology through working on projects with ESW. Catherine joined ESW in hopes of encouraging others to learn more about the crucial role engineering will play in paving a road for a sustainable future. In her spare time, Catherine enjoys reading the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his ever-loyal sidekick, Dr. Watson, and increasing her arsenal of lame and cheesy jokes.

      <p>Calvin is a current student at California State University, Long Beach where he is pursuing his BS in mechanical engineering. After graduating from CSULB with a BS in mechanical engineering, he inspires to receive an MS in mechanical engineering in his future, and possibly work towards a PhD. He joined ESW his freshman year, looking to become more involved with the student organizations and the campus. Calvin wanted to become an engineer since he was a child because he was loved mathematics and science throughout his childhood, and the mechanical aspect of physics peaked his interest of becoming a future mechanical engineer. On his leisure time, Calvin likes to run long distances with his former cross-country team and compete in marathons or enjoying time with his friends and family where he is able to express his desires without having to think about going to class.
